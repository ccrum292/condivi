Unfinished, more to come.

## Use

From the root directory run yarn to install dependencies.

Before first use, you will need to add a faunadb secret key both to vercel (> vercel secrets add FAUNADB_SECRET_KEY [your-access-key]) and create a next.config.js file with the same format as the example found in this repo.

Use the command "yarn dev", from the root directory, to start a local app on port 3000.

To deploy your app, connect your github repo to Vercel.
